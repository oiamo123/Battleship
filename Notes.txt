Todo:
Create main page with either create new game or join game
Use a unique id for games
- Check if the id is already in use or not. Could use a unique 4 digit number and keep a set of ongoing games on the server

Allow users to choose a name
Allow users to place their pieces

Create the board (adjacency array)
Use numbers for the ships ie (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
0: nothing
Number > 0: ship
m: miss
x: hit
?: unique weapon
[[],

Create a class with the players board as well as their name
Could also use an id in the class

Teams?

Ideas: Add additional features like:
- Radar scan
- Different types of weapons
- Big bomb which is 3 wide
- Smaller bomb which is 2 wide
- I like the idea of a question mark to get unique weapons
    - Have to ensure that the question marks don't land on a ship ie get a weapon and hit a ship at the same time is not ideal
